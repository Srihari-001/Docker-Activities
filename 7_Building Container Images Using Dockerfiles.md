# Building Container Images Using Dockerfiles

## Introduction

Creating a container image by hand is possible, but it requires manual processes. There has to be a more automatic way to build images. Manual processes do not scale and are not easily version controlled. Docker provides a solution to this problem - the Dockerfile. In this lab, you will create a Dockerfile to build an image and host a static website.

## Solution

### Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

```bash
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
```

### Build a First Version

1. Change to the widget-factory-inc directory:

   ```bash
   cd widget-factory-inc
   ```

2. Create a Dockerfile that uses httpd:2.4 as the base image:

   ```bash
   vim Dockerfile
   ```

   In the new file, insert the following:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM httpd:2.4
   RUN apt update -y && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y && apt clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists*
   ```

   Save the file:

   - Press `ESC`
   - Type `:wq`

3. Verify that the file was saved successfully:

   ```bash
   cat Dockerfile
   ```

4. Build the 0.1 version of the widgetfactory image using the Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   docker build -t widgetfactory:0.1 .
   ```

5. Set variables to examine the image's size and layers:

   ```bash
   export showLayers='{{ range .RootFS.Layers }}{{ println . }}{{end}}'
   export showSize='{{ .Size }}'
   ```

6. Compare the httpd and widgetfactory images:

   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

7. Show the widgetfactory image's size:

   ```bash
   docker inspect -f "$showSize" widgetfactory:0.1
   ```

8. Show the layers:

   ```bash
   docker inspect -f "$showLayers" widgetfactory:0.1
   ```

9. Show the layers of the httpd:2.4 image:

   ```bash
   docker inspect -f "$showLayers" httpd:2.4
   ```

10. Compare the layers. Are they the same?

### Load the Website into the Container

11. Open the Dockerfile:

    ```bash
    vim Dockerfile
    ```

12. Remove the Apache welcome page from the image by adding the following:

    ```Dockerfile
    RUN rm -f /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
    ```

    Save the file:

    - Press `ESC`
    - Type `:wq`

13. Build version 0.2 of the widgetfactory image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t widgetfactory:0.2 .
    ```

14. Inspect both versions of the widgetfactory image to see the differences in size and layers:

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

15. Show the widgetfactory:0.1 image's size:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showSize" widgetfactory:0.1
    ```

16. Compare it to the image size for widgetfactory:0.2:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showSize" widgetfactory:0.2
    ```

17. Using an interactive terminal, check the htdocs folder for widgetfactory:0.2. Are the website files in the folder?:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it widgetfactory:0.2 bash
    ls htdocs
    ```

    Exit the container:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

18. Show the layers for the widgetfactory:0.1 image:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showLayers" widgetfactory:0.1
    ```

19. Show the layers for the widgetfactory:0.2 image and compare the two:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showLayers" widgetfactory:0.2
    ```

20. Open the Dockerfile:

    ```bash
    vim Dockerfile
    ```

21. Add the website data to the container by adding the following to the end of the file:

    ```Dockerfile
    WORKDIR /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
    COPY ./web .
    ```

    Save the file:

    - Press `ESC`
    - Type `:wq`

22. Build version 0.3 of the widgetfactory image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t widgetfactory:0.3 .
    ```

23. Inspect versions 0.2 and 0.3 to see the differences in size and layers:

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

24. Show the widgetfactory:0.2 image's size:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showSize" widgetfactory:0.2
    ```

25. Compare it to the image size for widgetfactory:0.3:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showSize" widgetfactory:0.3
    ```

26. Show the layers for the widgetfactory:0.2 image:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showLayers" widgetfactory:0.2
    ```

27. Show the layers for the widgetfactory:0.3 image and compare the two:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f "$showLayers" widgetfactory:0.3
    ```

28. Using an interactive terminal, check the htdocs folder for widgetfactory:0.3:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it widgetfactory:0.3 bash
    ls -l
    ```

### Run a Container from the Image

29. Run a container from the widgetfactory:0.3 image. What command does it use to run the server? Remember to publish the web server port:

    ```bash
    docker run --name web1 -p 80:80 widgetfactory:0.3
    ```

30. Exit the container:

    - Press `CTRL+C`

31. Check the status of the container:

    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

32. Start the container:

    ```bash
    docker start web1
    ```

33. Using docker exec connect to the web1 container:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it web1 bash
    ```

34. View the website files in the container:

    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```

35. Exit the container:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

36. Retrieve the main website page from the container:

    ```bash
    wget localhost
    ```

37. Compare it to the copy on the server:

    ```bash
    diff index.html web/index.html
    ```
